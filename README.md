## Indiana DOE Math Standards

### 4th Grade

4.NS.6: Compare two decimals to hundredths by reasoning about their size based on the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with the symbols > , = , or < , and justify the conclusions (e.g., by using a visual model).

### 5th Grade

5.NS.1: Use a number line to compare and order fractions, mixed numbers, and decimals to thousandths. Write the results using > , = , and < symbols. 

5.NS.3: Explain patterns in the number of zeros of the product when multiplying a number by powers of 10, and explain patterns in the placement of the decimal point when a decimal is multiplied or divided by a power of 10. Use whole-number exponents to denote powers of 10. 

### 6th Grade
